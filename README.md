submodule
=========

submodule script

The documentation is inlined in the scripts

Essentially to run the tests you will:
1) run demo.sh first it will setup the local repos as well as create the plugin and repo

The out come of demo.sh is that there are two instances of the same repo.

2) part2.sh will create changes

3) part3.sh will checkout a new instance of the application in a correct stat for making alterations to the submodules.
